                              <strong>Platform Stats:</strong> Monitor key performance indicators at a glance. "Total Invested" shows the total capital deployed across all users. "Total Users" and "Active Accounts" (users with an investment > 0) track growth and engagement. "Pending KYC" highlights the number of users awaiting identity verification, a crucial step for platform compliance.

                              <strong>Date Simulation (Core Demo Feature):</strong> This is a unique and powerful tool for demonstrating the platform's financial logic over time.
                              <ul className="list-['-_'] list-inside ml-4 mt-2 space-y-2">
                                  <li><strong>Advancing Days:</strong> Clicking "Advance 1/7/30 Day(s)" simulates the passage of time. For each day advanced, the system performs a critical background task: calculating and distributing the daily 'Profit Share' for <em>every active investment</em> on the platform. This profit is calculated based on the investment amount and the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of its associated pool, divided by 365. This action adds a 'Profit Share' transaction to each investor's wallet.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Crossing a Month's Boundary:</strong> The true power of the simulation is revealed when your clicks cause the date to cross into a new month (e.g., advancing from Nov 28th to Dec 5th). When this happens, the system automatically triggers the complete <strong>end-of-month calculation cycle</strong> for the month that just ended. This includes:
                                      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside ml-6 mt-1 space-y-1">
                                          <li><strong>Rank Calculation:</strong> The system evaluates every single user against the rank requirements defined in the 'Settings' tab. It checks their total active downline and the number of newly qualified members they recruited that month to determine if they qualify for a promotion.</li>
                                          <li><strong>Leadership Bonus Payout:</strong> For every user who is promoted to a new rank, the system immediately pays out the corresponding one-time 'Leadership Bonus' (fixed bonus amount) into their wallet.</li>
                                          <li><strong>Asset Growth Bonus Calculation:</strong> The system calculates the 'Asset Growth' bonus for every user based on the total investment value of their entire downline, paying out a percentage of that total asset value.</li>
                                      </ol>
                                  </li>

                          <li>
                              <strong>Platform Charts:</strong> Visualize key financial trends. The "Inflow vs. Outflow" chart is critical for monitoring the platform's cash flow health (Deposits vs. Withdrawals). "Daily New Investments" tracks growth momentum and user confidence. "Payouts by Rank" reveals how bonus distributions are spread across different leadership levels, helping to analyze the compensation plan's balance.

                          <li><strong>Edit User:</strong> Modify a user's core details, such as their name, rank, and total investment. <strong>Important:</strong> Changing a user's upline will affect all future bonus calculations for both the old and new upline. This should be done with caution.</li>

                                   <li><em>Adjust Rank:</em> Manually set a user's rank to any level from 1 to 9. This is a direct override and does not require the user to meet the standard criteria. A reason is required for logging purposes.</li>

A frozen user cannot log in, perform any actions (like investing or withdrawing), and will not receive any further bonuses until their account is unfrozen. This is a useful tool for compliance reviews or temporary suspensions.</li>
                          <li><strong>Review KYC:</strong> When a user's KYC status is "Pending," you can click the status badge to open the review modal. Here you can view their (mock) submitted documents and choose to either "Approve" or "Reject" their application, which updates their status and notifies the user.</li>
